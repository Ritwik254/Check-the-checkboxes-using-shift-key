# Check-the-checkboxes-using-shift-key


Description: This JavaScript code provides a feature for selecting multiple checkboxes in a list by holding down the Shift key and clicking. When the Shift key is held and the user clicks the first checkbox and then another checkbox in the range, all checkboxes in between will be selected or deselected based on the order of clicks. The code uses event listeners to achieve this functionality.

Usage: To use this code in your project, include the JavaScript file and ensure that your HTML has a list of checkboxes you want to enable this feature for. Add event listeners to your checkboxes and invoke the handleClick function when a checkbox is clicked. The code is highly customizable and can be integrated easily into web applications that require checkbox range selection.
